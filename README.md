# Newsroom Team Branding Assessment

## Hello!

Thank you for applying to the position of Newsroom Developer! If you read this, it means that we've had a great time
getting to know you and would like you to do a small test to assess some basic skills.


## Instructions

The file `index.html` contains a page with some PressPage modules that only have some default styling.
It has a 2-column layout which changes to a 1-column layout when the screen size gets smaller than 600px.

The goal of this assignment is to give those PressPage modules the same look and feel as the content on this website:
http://www.trajectum.hu.nl/

Try to find elements/sections on the Trajectum website which can be used to make the PressPage modules look like they 
are a part of the design of the that website. Design elements like fonts, colors, icons, spacing, aspect-ratios, 
etc. should all be styled similarly to how the Trajectum website looks.

You should do this by adding CSS to the included `style.css` file so that those styles will overwrite the default 
styles in the HTML file.

The HTML in `index.html` should not be altered!

The assignment should not take longer than 2 hours.


## When you're finished

Please make a `.zip` of the repository and email it to the person you were in contact with about the assignment.
